<p>Hello World! This is our first Udacity course. My wife and I are driving up the 101 from southern california right now. Its 82 degrees outside and the heat feels great. We are hugging the coast and gazing upon the surfers. Web design is a great career. My wife and I both picture ourselves working in a field were we can pick up our laptops anywhere and do our work.</p>
